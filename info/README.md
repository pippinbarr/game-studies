## Description
*"Step into my magic circle!" Said the designer to the player! "There will be flow states! And narrative! And no ludology! Or no narrative and a lot of ludology! Whatever you prefer! It will be ergodic if not erotic! And it will be so immersive you just might drown in it!""*

_Game Studies_ was created in [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) with [Jonathan Lessard](http://www.jonathanlessard.net/). Sounds are all CC0 from [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org) except for [&#8220;Firework &#8211; take off &#8211; small pop&#8221; by Quistard](https://freesound.org/people/Quistard/sounds/237753/). _Game Studies_ stars sprites of Brendon Massey in his role as John Carey in _[Police Quest: Open Season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Quest:_Open_Season)_.

If you want to, you can [play the identical build of the game over on Jonathan's website](http://jonathanlessard.net/GameStudies/) as well.
